# LeanTween

LeanTween is an efficient tweening engine for Unity3d.
This is a fork of the original LeanTween by Dented Pixel modified to work as a Unity Package Manager package.

### Full Documentation:

http://dentedpixel.com/LeanTweenDocumentation/classes/LeanTween.html
This can also be accessed offline! From the Unity menu Help->LeanTween Documentation.

### Getting Started

LeanTween examples have been moved to the `Samples~/Examples` folder and should appear in the UPM Samples window.

### TODO

- Modify `LeanTweenDocumentationEditor.cs` so it can access the correct documentation path from the Unity Help menu
